### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Faaraan Kazi. My main interest lies in Data Science & AI.

I have fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) such as LLaVA and LLaMA using advanced techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA). These techniques have enhanced my ability to adapt pre-trained models for specific tasks efficiently, optimizing both performance and computational resources.

### Key Skills:
-> Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, LLMs, Python, R, Django, Power BI, Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, MySQL, C, MongoDB, NodeJS, HTML5, CSS, Analytical Libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on AI & ML projects
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working best practices for fine-tuning LLMs
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on with LLMs project
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ML libraries, Python, LLMs, Deep Learning, NLP, PowerBI and Tableau
